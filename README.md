In order to interact with the program a few python packages will need to be installed; they include requests, plotly, Beautiful Soup, and sqlite (in order to create the database) 

An API key from the OMDb web API is required. The key is free to obtain from http://www.omdbapi.com/ 
  Select API key on the top menu and enter your email for a free key, you'll be asked to verify your email and your key will be automatically generated for you.
  
The command line is used to interact with the program, the user will be prompted to enter movie titles and the option to use graphs. If a movie title is entered the ratings for that movie will be displayed, if graph is chosen a new prompt will ask which graph the user will like to view. If the user chooses ratings, another option to view top or bottom will be given. All interactions are used via the command line. 

The CSV's used to create the database are provided to create the database but, are not required if those functions are commented out.
